# Unit 2: Multi-tool File System Agent

This unit builds upon the basic agent and adds:

- File system tools (read/write/mkdir)
- Tool management system
- Persistent message history
- Execution loop
- JSON parameter parsing

The agent can now interact with the file system and perform complex workflows.
