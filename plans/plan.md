# Plan: Intro to Agents (Learning Repo)

## Purpose

Live-coding and class exploration for an intro-to-agents course. Code is kept minimal and legible, not productionized.

## Conventions

All work in this repo follows **[/plans/learning-conventions.md](learning-conventions.md)**. That file overrides normal best practices (e.g. no centralized logging, minimal deps, fewest lines, simplest runnable code).

## Structure

- **`/plans`** — plan.md, learning-conventions.md, optional requirements.md when deps exist.
- **`/devlog`** — optional diary entries for multi-step or narrative-heavy work.
- **Root or topic folders** — small, self-contained scripts and examples (one main idea per file when possible).

## Execution

1. Before adding code, check learning-conventions.md.
2. Prefer stdlib; add dependencies only when necessary for the lesson.
3. Keep examples runnable with minimal setup (e.g. `python example.py`).
4. Use clear names and short files so students can follow along in class.
